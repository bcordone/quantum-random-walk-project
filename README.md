# quantum-random-walk-project

This project explores quantum random walk algorithms. The first file TwoPosition QRW has the code for the 2 Position QRW. This includes the Circular QRW, Number Line QRW, and the Weighted Coin QRW. The file ThreePosition QRW contains the expansion of the circular QRW to 3 positions states. The 3 position circuit was run on the IBM hardware. The last file, FivePosition QRW is the code for 5 position state qubits. Different intital conditions and steps were attempted for all circuits.
